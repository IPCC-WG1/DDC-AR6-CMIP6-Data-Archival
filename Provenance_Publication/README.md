## Provenance Publication

The provenance information on CMIP6 data usage in the generation of figures of the IPCC AR6 WGI was published to Zendo for each figure as a pilot implementation of the RDA Complex Citation Working Groups recommendations.

The publication required two steps:

1. [create record](/Provenance_Publication/create_record): create files (human-readable csv and preliminary machine-accessible Complex Citation Object json-ld) and metadata to be uploaded to Zenodo
2. [publish record](/Provenance_Publication/publish_record): upload files to Zenodo and publish Zenodo record through the API
